The assignment is all about creating a newspaper/magazine webpage, using the CSS techniques Flexbox and/or Grid. The assignment also includes to make the page responsive to mobile, tablet and desktop view. Since I'm a HUGE yoga, meditation and wellness fan/advocate I wanted to create something similar to a magazine with calm color tones and a somewhat subtle design, with inspiring headlines. 

## The problem

I was really excited and nervous about starting this project, mostly since I'm unfamiliar with CSS Flexbox and Grid, but also since I had no idea how to make a page responsive. I started by sketching it Mobile First (on paper) to get an idea. Since I did not want to set my ambitions TOO HIGH (due to lack of knowledge) I decided to aim for the blue level on this assignment. I have been doing SO much Googling (I should be entitled "Junior Professional Googler" by now), talking and writing to team-mates and also read a lot on Stack Overflow (that is ONE amazing place to be, WOW).

The ride this week has certainly been a rollercoaster. I don't remember the last time I cried this much during ONE week but here I am. Doing my finishing touches and my brain is SO tired and packed with all of this new information but my heart.. my heart is FULL. HAPPY. PROUD. I have learned some awesome new tools, such as Flexbox (that I really want to dive in further cause I don't really get the hang of it (oh you don't say, do ya?) and Grid is super-interesting. I've also familiarized myself with VS Code and The Terminal. I've discovered so many cool sites where you can fetch things to help you build things. It's been a really tough journey this week with so many ups and downs but I'm happy with the work I have accomplished. But there are so many more things I would have investigated further if I had had the time / mental capacity, such as how to make the page responsive to even further devices/sizes/resolutions. And also I think I would put some more effort into really reading up. But the study material has been great, I most enjoyed the Flexbox-video with Jennie where there's a count of how many times the word FLEXBOX is being mentioned!*
